Først kommer de til et 'collection center', hvor de fx får taget fingeraftryk. Dette sker, da mange - især mænd - tager tilbage til Sydsudan for at kæmpe samtidig med, at de forsørger deres familie i Bidibidi. Næste stop er i et 'Transit' hvor flygtninge får udleveret basale nødvendigheder samt mad. Her fandt vi også store telte, da Bidibidi i perioder modtager flere tusinde flygtninge om dagen, som risikere at skulle blive i et par nætter. Derefter kommer 'reception center', hvor flygtningene kan sidde i timevis og vente på at blive registreret. Hvis de ikke tidligere har fået et armbånd, så vil de få det her. Et blåt armbånd betyder 'normal' - altså en person uden yderligere behov, mens et gult armbånd betyder at personen har et særligt behov. Det kan være et handicap, at personen leder efter familie i bosættelsen eller lignende. Det sidste armbånd er det hvide, som sættes om håndleddet på uledsagede børn. I 'reception center' fandt vi også store telte, hvor de to køn sover adskilt ad et hegn for at undgå voldtægter. Derudover er det det sidste sted, de opholder sig, før de skal ud i bosættelsen. Det er derfor også her, de får udleveret de ting, som de får med sig ud i bosættelsen - bl.a. gryder, majs og tæpper. Sidste trin, som vi blev ført igennem, var ude i bosættelsen. Det er her Folkekirkens Nødhjælps arbejde kommer ind i billedet, da de her igennem diverse projekter hjælper udvalgte flygtninge til bl.a. at tjene penge for arbejde, starte egne projekter, lave låne-sparre grupper og meget, meget mere.

Sparelånegrupperne består af flygtninge, som har slået sig sammen i grupper for at få mulighed for at spare og låne penge sammen. Grupperne mødes en gang om ugen, hvor hver person hver især lægger penge til siden, som hun eller han kan undvære. Efterhånden som grupperne sammen får fyldt pengekassen op, begynder de at låne penge til hinanden. Dén der har mest brug for hjælp, har førsteret. Der er mange forskellige motivationsgrunde for at spare penge sammen; nogen håber på en dag at kunne give deres børn en uddannelse, andre drømmer om at starte en virksomhed, købe et stykke land der kan dyrkes eller meget andet. Folkekirkens Nødhjælp hjælper sparelånegrupperne med at starte op, giver dem bøger hvor forskellige beløb kan noteres, en pengekasse og underviser desuden nogle af medlemmerne i at holde styr på gruppen og pengene.\nSparelånegruppe-projektet er et godt eksempel på, at nødhjælp også kan være hjælp til selvhjælp. Selvom det måske ikke lige nu er mange penge, der kan lægges til siden, kan det på sigt være noget, der kan gøre en stor forskel i den enkeltes liv. På den måde er det en bæredygtig løsning, som passer ind i mottoet med ikke at give en fisk, men i stedet en fiskestang, der på sigt kan fange mange fisk.\nAf de utroligt mange ting, vi lærte under vores besøg hos sydsudanesiske flygtninge i Bidibidi i Uganda, er dét, at det rent faktisk nytter noget at hjælpe, og at hjælpen endda gør en kæmpe forskel, men også at der fortsat er brug for endnu mere hjælp, helt klart noget af det, vi har taget med os hjem og vil forsøge at sprede budskabet om🌍😊💸🇺🇬🌞.'}}]","Bp2iZwNlOwQ","[]","2018"

She’s leaving behind her three children, one of them is her one and a half year old son Jimmy who always cheered us up when at their plot. \nI still remember the first time I was sitting and talking to her. We’re both born in ’92 but our lives have been so incredibly different. Here is what she told me about her life:\n.\n“I grew up in Khartoum and had never heard or seen of any fights. My life was good, I was staying with my brothers and my husband was working. That changed after we moved to Juba. In July 2016 war broke out and I heard gunshots from morning to night. I was so scared all the time, I could barely move. \nI saw dead people everywhere and there was no food. After a bomb landed on our neighbors house in Juba the government soldiers moved us to Luri, 75 miles out of Juba. Three days later they brought us back and I found several of my neighbors lying on the streets, they had been shot and killed. We found so many dead bodies.”\n.\n”The days after that there was not enough food. I didn’t know how we should survive so we decided to move to Yei. I thought Yei would be safe but there we got the same problems and a month later we had to leave to Uganda. We were walking and it took us three days to reach the border.”\n.\n”Many of my relatives were in settlements in Uganda and told us we shouldn’t come. But I saw people getting slaughtered in front of us so we had to leave. We knew that there was no food on any of the sides and that some of the local communities didn’t want us to be here. But what should we do? Our children have to continue going to school so that they can go back to our country and change the situation when it’s getting more peaceful again.”\n.\n“My life in Uganda won’t change. When I was ill they only gave me painkillers for Malaria at the health center. When I went to a private clinic I got injections but that was expensive.“\n.\n“When South Sudan became independent we were very hopeful so it’s painful to see what happened. I hope that we can go back home and live in peace.”'}}]","BlLH0-IFryc","[]","2018"

I wanted to get married since I’m an orphan and was staying with my brothers wife who did treat me really bad. My mother passed away when she was giving birth to my sister in 2007 and my father died in 2011. I remember suffering when I also lost my father. I had to stop school and they left me to stay with my aunt where I was beaten. That women did let her children go to school but I had to be home and work. Now it’s better since I’m staying with my husband. He’s making some money with smaller projects like building houses for people in our area. So when we have money I want to have children but not now.”\n.\nHere Viola is standing in front of her Milaya with her nieces Christine Kiden, 5 and Betty Nyoka, 4.\n.\n.\nAbout the Milaya portrait series:\nIn August the one millionth refugee from South Sudan entered Uganda in escape of the war.\xa0\nWith most of the refugees being women and children and leaving during shootings at night their bedsheets called Milaya are often one of the few things they carry with them.

After the fighting intensified in their village in Yei, Lilias decided to bring her family to Uganda, leaving behind her husband – working as a driver in Juba.\n“They were slaughtering everyone around us. If we refused to open the door they would set fire to our home. I wouldn’t let it come to that so I ran.\n\nThey walked for three days to reach Uganda. Lilias cooked a meal of okra for her family for the first two days, while they were traveling. For the final day of their journey Lilias and her children went hungry. “There was nothing we could eat on the way so we had to wait until we got to Uganda. I had always been able to feed my children with the food I grew on my farm in South Sudan. I was angry that we had nothing to eat and that I had to leave my farm behind.” When Lilias and her family crossed to Uganda, they arrived the Kerwa border collection point, where they received high energy biscuits from the World Food Programme to sustain them until they reached the reception centre at BidiBidi, where they ate their first full hot meal in three days – posho (maize) and beans. “Once I saw my children eat, I remember thinking - at least here in Uganda we can finally eat, sleep and feel safe.” #BidiBidi reached full capacity in December 2016 and continues to host the most refugees in #Uganda, more than 272,000.\n\n_____________________________\nPhoto: Claire Nevill / Story: Beyond Bidibidi (Follow on Instagram: @beyondbidibidi)'}}]","BcxenPKlKUM","['Uganda', 'refugees', 'BidiBidi']","2017"

And because I was only in elementary school, I never really fully understood what he was doing there. And even now, looking back at it, it's hard to grasp absolutely everything he did. But it did do one very important thing for me. It instilled in me a heart for missions. Seeing all of the things he was doing there made me want to do the same. It helped give me a love for the people in that region that most people don't have. The difference between the first trip I took and this one was astounding. Seeing all of the Southern Sudanese refugees touched me in such a different way. Knowing that the majority of the people that I met have never seen peace in their country, and are now displaced for most likely not the first time, broke my heart. But seeing the love that they have for Christ is insane. They trust in Him more than I've ever seen anyone trust in Him before. Worship is the fuel and the end goal of missions, and seeing the passion that they have for God is mind blowing. I went there in hopes to teach them something, and instead, despite all their pain and suffering, they helped to remind me that the joy of the Lord is the greatest joy possible.\n\nAll these pieces, broken and scattered, in mercy gathered, mended and whole. Empty handed, but not forsaken, I've been set free, I've been set free. You take our failure, you take our weakness, you set your treasure in jars of clay.
