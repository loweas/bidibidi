My life was good, I was staying with my brothers and my husband was working. That changed after we moved to Juba. In July 2016 war broke out and I heard gunshots from morning to night. I was so scared all the time, I could barely move. \nI saw dead people everywhere and there was no food. After a bomb landed on our neighbors house in Juba the government soldiers moved us to Luri, 75 miles out of Juba. Three days later they brought us back and I found several of my neighbors lying on the streets, they had been shot and killed. We found so many dead bodies.”\n.\n”The days after that there was not enough food. I didn’t know how we should survive so we decided to move to Yei. I thought Yei would be safe but there we got the same problems and a month later we had to leave to Uganda. We were walking and it took us three days to reach the border.”\n.\n”Many of my relatives were in settlements in Uganda and told us we shouldn’t come. But I saw people getting slaughtered in front of us so we had to leave. We knew that there was no food on any of the sides and that some of the local communities didn’t want us to be here. But what should we do? Our children have to continue going to school so that they can go back to our country and change the situation when it’s getting more peaceful again.”\n.\n“My life in Uganda won’t change. When I was ill they only gave me painkillers for Malaria at the health center. When I went to a private clinic I got injections but that was expensive.“\n.\n“When South Sudan became independent we were very hopeful so it’s painful to see what happened.
